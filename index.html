                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                    fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
                    the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                    structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
                    between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                    different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                    speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
                    alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters,
                    hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID
                    may only be applied to a single element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not
                    contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which
                    identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the
                    mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A
                    pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element
                    makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter

                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                    in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                    Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                    Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                    constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                    JavaScript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                    JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                    class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                    JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                    loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                    have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                    be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                    you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                    function return types are not explicitly typed.

                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
              greetMe("World");
            </code>

                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="colors">
            <header>Colors</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.
            </p>

            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                    always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                    warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                    below.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

            <article>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                    called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.</p>
                <p> JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                    rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                    global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                    code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                    context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                    is an if statement. </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                    ECMAScript 2015. </p>
                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
              defined</code>
